 #Problem Setup

  Input is a list of numeric ranges
  Example: 95-115
  For every number in each range, check if it’s invalid
  Add all invalid IDs

  #Part 1

  An ID is invalid if:
  It consists of a digit sequence repeated exactly twice

  Examples:

  11 → 1 | 1
  6464 → 64 | 64
  123123 → 123 | 123

  Step-by-step logic

  For each range [low, high]:
  For each number n in that range:
  Count digits
  Try splitting into two equal halves
  If both halves are identical → invalid
  Add all invalid IDs

  #RTL Logic
  Counters iterate ranges and numbers
  Comparators + division by powers of 10
  Accumulator for sum

  *ANS -> 34826702005
  
  #Part 2


  An ID is invalid if:
  It consists of any digit sequence repeated ≥ 2 times
 
  Examples:

  1111111 → 1 × 7
  121212 → 12 × 3
  123123123 → 123 × 3

  Step-by-step logic

  For each number:
  Try all possible base pattern lengths
  Repeatedly check if the pattern matches the remaining digits

  If:

  Entire number is consumed
  Repetition count ≥ 2
→ invalid
  Add to sum

  #RTL Logic

  FSM-based repeated comparison

  *ANS -> 43287141963
