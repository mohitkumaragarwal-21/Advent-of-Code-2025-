DAY 1 — The Secret Entrance

    #Part 1

1.  Problem Setup

 . Start at position 50
 . Positions are on a circular track of size 100 → positions 0 to 99

  Each instruction has:

  Direction: L (left) or R (right)
  Value: number of steps

  Wrapping rules:

  If position < 0 → wrap to 99
  If position > 99 → wrap to 0
 
  Every time you land on position 0, you count it


  Each instruction moves you in a single jump:

  L → pos = pos - value
  R → pos = pos + value  
  Then wrap to [0–99]
  Count if final position is 0

  # Step-by-step logic

  Initialize:
  pos = 50
  count = 0

  For each instruction:
  Move left or right by value
  Apply wraparound

  If pos == 0, increment count

  After all instructions:
  Output count
  
  -> RTL Logic

  One instruction = one clock cycle
  Simple arithmetic + wrap logic
  Counter increments conditionally
  Pure register-transfer logic

  *ANS-> 1165

   #Part 2 


  Instead of jumping:
  Move one step at a time
  Do this for value steps
  Count every time position becomes 0 (including intermediate steps)

 ->  Step-by-step logic

  Initialize:
  pos = 50
  count = 0

  For each instruction:
  Set steps_remaining = value
  While steps_remaining > 0:
  Move one step (L or R)
  Apply wraparound immediately
  If pos == 0, increment count
  Decrement steps_remaining
  Continue until all instructions are processed

 # RTL Logic

  Inner loop = time
  One movement per clock cycle

  Requires:

  Step counter
  FSM to control instruction vs step execution

  FSM + counters

  *ANS -> 6496
